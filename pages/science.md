Exoplanet science, the study of planets orbiting around other stars, gives us clues as to 
how planets form, the position of our own Solar System in the vast parameter space of possible 
planets, and how prevalent habitable worlds may be in our Galaxy. They may also provide 
us with clues as to the Earth's past and possible future and understanding on how unique
our planet is. These are pivotal issues to scientists and society as a whole and help us 
better understand the world we live in.


The goal of EXOWORLD is to develop innovative planet characterisation techniques to 
understand the evolution of planetary systems and explore what makes a habitable world. 

The project will focus on several broad aspects of exoplanet research:

<h3><li>Exoplanet detection and characterisation</li></h3>

<h3><li>Statistics</li></h3>

<h3><li>Exoplanet atmospheres and habitability</li></h3>


Some of the exoplanet planet detection and characterisation methods that we make use of are -

<h2> Transit </h2>

A transit occurs when a planet orbits its host star across the line of sight of the observer.
During a transit, the planet blocks the light from the star which makes it appear dimmer.
The transit photometry measures the change in stellar brightness when a transit occurs. 
In the presence of a planet, the star's light curve will show a characteristic "dip" periodically.

<h2> Radial velocity </h2>

In a planetary system, the host star "wobbles" about the center of mass or changes its velocity 
because it experiences gravitational pull from the planet. The spectrum of the star is blueshifted 
when the star moves towards us. When the star moves away from us, its spectrum redshifted.
The radial velocity methods monitors the spectrum of the host star and searches for velocity 
changes due to the presence of a planet.

<!-- Transit spectroscopy - ESA, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO
Spectroscopy is the technique of splitting received starlight into its different colours 
using a prism. Exoplanets orbit their stars, when they transit – pass by from our point of 
view – some of the starlight passes through the planet’s atmosphere. Particles in the 
atmosphere like water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and others absorb some of that light. 
This absorption happens at specific wavelengths of light. By studying at which wavelengths 
the starlight is absorbed, we can determine what kind of particles are present in the 
atmosphere. The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope uses this technique to characterise 
exoplanets and ESA’s Ariel mission will study the atmospheres of as many as 1000 exoplanets 
this way. Both missions focus on infrared light because the signatures of molecules are 
very prominent in those colours. -->
