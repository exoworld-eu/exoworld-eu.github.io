Understanding the evolution of EXOplanets and towards habitable WORLDs (EXOWORLD) is a consortium comprises 12 organisations from 8 countries and it will leverage interdisciplinary and international expertise to study the diversity of exoplanets.
The objective of EXOWORLD is to develop novel detection, characterisation and statistical techniques for understanding the fundamental physics which drives the evolution of planetary systems and find out what set of conditions lead to a habitable world.

The EXOWORLD project is supported by the European Union under the Horizon Europe Programme Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions Staff Exchanges (Project ID: 101086149; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101086149/program/43108390/details">CORDIS</a>).
