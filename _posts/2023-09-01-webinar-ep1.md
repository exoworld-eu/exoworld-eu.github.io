The first EXOWORLD webinar was held on 31st August 2023, where DLR PhD student, Jan-Vincent Harre, presented results from his exchange with the Astrobiology Center. You can revisit his talk on our project <a href="https://youtu.be/hOgVUFN5kqw" style="color:#294CF8; target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Youtube Channel</a>!

<b>Title:</b> Measuring orbital obliquities of warm Jupiters and Brown Dwarfs

<b>Abstract:</b>
Understanding orbital obliquities, or the misalignment angles between a star's rotation axis and the orbital axis of its planets, is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms of planetary formation and migration. In this webinar, I will discuss what I learned during my EXOWORLD trip to the Astrobiology Center at the NAOJ Mitaka campus in Tokyo and present an analysis of Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations of warm Jupiters and Brown Dwarfs. For this, high-precision radial velocity measurements were obtained with HARPS and HARPS-N during the transits of these objects. The RM observations are analyzed using a code which models the RM anomaly together with the Keplerian orbit given several parameters in combination with a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation. As a first result, we measure the projected stellar obliquity in the WASP-106 system for the first time and find λ = (-1.05 ± 11.31)°, supporting the theory of quiescent migration through the disk for this warm Jupiter.
