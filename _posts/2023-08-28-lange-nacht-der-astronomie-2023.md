The “Lange Nacht der Astronomie“ (long night of astronomy) took place in Berlin Tempelhof on the 12th of August 2023. There were many booths addressing space-related topics like our solar system, space instrumentation or how telescopes work. In addition to these, there was also a mobile planetarium for the guests to enjoy.

Besides the quiz for kids that was offered by the DLR, we also handed out posters and booklets about the solar system and space in general. There were many interesting questions asked, for example about the beginning of the universe, what an exoplanet is or about space debris and how to clean it up. Once it got darker, you could, if you were lucky enough, see some of the Perseid meteors.

In general, there were a lot of interest in this event with long queues building up especially to look through the telescopes at night.
